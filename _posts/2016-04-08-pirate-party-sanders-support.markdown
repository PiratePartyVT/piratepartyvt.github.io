###Pirate Party VT Supports Bernie Sanders
This is an emergency call to all Pirate Party members to officially support Bernie Sanders for the 2016 Presidential Election.

Before anything else it should be said that the following does not claim to be an official statement of the Pirate Party in general. This is a consensus view of a small group in Vermont whose interests are rooted in Pirate Party issues. As the Pirate Party in Vermont forms itself and grows it is very possible this will not be agreeable to all involved at which point another statement will be drafted and published which expresses a possibly different collective view or views. The Pirate Party, in general,  is different than most third parties in that its general approach is to start its organization locally and expand influence from there. None the less, through discussion, the topics of Presidential politics invariably arise as well as voter registration. That being said...

Division in the United States is at an all time high. This is multi-fold for sure, however, at its core, this division is certainly the result of a broken two party system which has zero interest in representing the people whom made and enable it. Left to continue as is, political functionality in this country is a soon to be corpse. In an ideal world (and in the base structure of our Constitution) anyone may be President. This is a fairytale however. More than ever this is blatantly obvious. In that theoretical world the Pirate Party, and any other third party, actually stands a chance in Office. However, in this moment, we as Pirates MUST wake up from this delusion if we want to effect actual change and promote a future where the Pirate Party DOES in fact stand a chance to hold an office which can actually influence policy. The Democratic Party elites have actually made sure third parties are rendered moot via super delegates. The Republican Party has voiced a desire for something similar during this cycle. Without getting too deep into this and risking a rant, super delegates are actually an assault on the voice of the American people and ensure nothing less than election fraud and censorship.

The importance of this can not be overstated. The media are literally slandering and silencing Sanders and of course a slew of other candidates whom very few are even aware are running at all. We will not get into other third candidates here in order to avoid losing the topic. Suffice it to say none other than Sanders has enough behind them to overcome the very rigged system we are all under at the moment. If the media and THEIR candidates have their way it will mean the final death blow to ALL Pirate Party issues in the United States. It is more important than ever to realize that now is not the time for the Pirate Party in the United States to hold nationally influential office. This country has been raped for well over 100 years by the 1% over and over again. To not acknowledge this is irresponsible. Realistically it seems unlikely the United States will go from total corruption to our Pirate Utopia in a single step. Our evolution must be a progressive and measured one. We need to come together and lay the groundwork for future elections where we WILL stand a chance at addressing our issues.

With the above in mind please consider the following actions...

* Vote for Bernie Sanders as President of the United States
* Promote Bernie Sanders via social media & general daily conversation IRL
* Expose the threats to our Pirate issues posed by Clinton and Trump
* Expose the bought silence & hypocrisy of main stream media
* IF SANDERS IS SHUT OUT OF THE ELECTION THEN WRITE HIM IN

At this moment Bernie Sanders is the only candidate with enough exposure and momentum who has a track record of representing the voice of the people and actually dismantling the corporate state which tirelessly tries to put an end to issues dear to our Pirate Code, and thus, hope for the future of the Pirate Party in the United States as an influential force. This is not intended to be fear mongering or shocking. This is not at all an attempt to co-opt the Pirate Party in the United States. We are merely interested in looking openly and objectively at what we have to work with in attaining a sane and truly representative government which we are actually allowed, as well as encouraged, to take part in.
