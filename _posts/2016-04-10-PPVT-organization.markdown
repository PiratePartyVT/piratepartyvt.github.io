As of 2016 there are five recognized political parties in the state of Vermont. They break down as such...

### Major
* Democratic
* Progressive
* Republican

### Minor
* Libertarian
* Liberty Union

Our goal is to add a sixth to that list. Keep in mind, currently, PPVT is not looking at national elections, but focused on local politics and representation. As part of our upcoming planning party (time and location TBA), Pirate Party Vermont is going over Vermont's party organization statutes. Have a look...

and here is some more information (which we've copied below)...

Essentially we need to organize at town and state levels to qualify as a minor party.

----

####Town level organization

The basics of organizing a new political party at the town level in Vermont require the following:

#####Town Caucus

* To begin organizing a minor party at the town level, three interested voters in a Vermont town who seek to organize a party will designate one of their number the duties of the [town chair](http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=17&Chapter=045&Section=02303)

* The town chair must notify the date, place, time and purpose of the town caucus.  At least 5 days before the day of the caucus, the town chair must post the notice in the town clerk's office and in at least one other public place in town, and in towns with populations greater than 1,000, the town chair must also publish the notice in a newspaper having general circulation in the town.

* The caucus must be held in a public place within the town. Although "public place" is not defined in the law, the caucus can be held at any stated location where the general public is welcome. It should be a place that is both familiar to voters in town and accessible to them. In very small towns, a house could be used, if it is familiar and accessible to voters and if no other public space is available.

#####Town committees

* At a town caucus, voters of the party in the town will meet and proceed to elect a town committee to serve for the following two years or until their successors are elected. The most recent town checklist should be used to determine who may participate. There is no set number of committee members. The number is determined by each town caucus. Election to the town committee gives members the right to vote on matters before the committee.

* The statute allows "voters of the party residing in town" to participate in the caucus. The statute does not provide a litmus test for party voter status or grant any authority to any person to limit participation of others on some doctrinal or other test. If a voter appears at the caucus door, and his or her name appears on the checklist, the voter should be permitted to enter.[*](http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=17&Chapter=045&Section=02304)

* The officers of the town committee must include a chair, vice chair, secretary, treasurer and assistant treasurer. They need not be elected members of the town committee to be elected as officers, although they become members after they are elected. Each officer position must be filled. There must be at least 3 voters present at a caucus to create a committee. A person may serve in more than one office, but the same person cannot serve as chair and vice-chair, or as treasurer and vice-treasurer. If there is a contest for nomination, recommendation, or election to any office or position at any committee level, the law requires that a secret ballot be used.[*](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_requirements_for_political_parties_in_Vermont#cite_note-8) [**](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_requirements_for_political_parties_in_Vermont#cite_note-9)

* Immediately after the town committee has been elected, the first meeting of the town committee must be held.[*](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_requirements_for_political_parties_in_Vermont#cite_note-10) The principal responsibility of the town committee is to elect officers and to elect delegates to the state committee if the party seeks minor political party status.

* Within 72 hours of the town caucus, the chair and secretary of the town committee must mail a copy of the notice calling the caucus and a certified list of names and addresses of officers and members of the town committee to:

    * The Secretary of State.
    * The state party chair.
    * The town clerk.

----

####State level organization

#####State committees

* The state committee must meet at a time, place and date set by the state chair. The state chair is required to notify all members of the state committee in writing at least 7 days before the meeting date. The state committee of the party also elects officers.[*](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_requirements_for_political_parties_in_Vermont#cite_note-17) [**](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_requirements_for_political_parties_in_Vermont#cite_note-18)

* Within 10 days of the first meeting of the state committee, the chair and secretary must file the certification form stating that the party has elected officers and completed its organization in at least 10 towns for minor party status. The certificate must include the names and addresses of all the officers and all members of the state committee. A copy of the notice calling the first meeting of the state committee must also be filed with the certification. The rules or by-laws of the state party must also be filed. The Secretary of State will notify all state chairs when their filings are complete or, if they are incomplete, what is needed to complete certification.[*](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_requirements_for_political_parties_in_Vermont#cite_note-19) [**](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_requirements_for_political_parties_in_Vermont#cite_note-20)

#####Party bylaws
Every committee of a political party is authorized to adopt rules and bylaws. Every rule or bylaw may be amended by simple majority vote of those present and voting at any meeting of the committee, provided that written notice of the proposed amendment is given to all committee members at least seven days prior to the meeting. All rules, bylaws and amendments must be filed with the Secretary of State, and the copies so filed with the Secretary of State shall be the official copies.[21]

#####Filing deadline
The chair and secretary of the party's state committee must file a Certificate of Organization by January 1 of the year of the election stating that the party has completed its organization for the ensuing two years, that it has organized in at least 10 towns in Vermont, and has complied by the organizational requirements of the law.[22]

#####Nomination of candidates
Nominations of minor party candidates must be made by the following political committee of the party:

  * For statewide and federal offices, the state committee of the party will nominate.

  * For the State House, the representative district committee of the party will nominate. The representative district committee will be made up of members of a town committee residing in the representative district containing the office.[23]

  * For the State Senate, the senatorial district committee of the party will nominate.[23]
