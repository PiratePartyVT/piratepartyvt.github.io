We're in the process of planning a planning party :)

Join us in IRC or, if no one is there, just DM via Twitter in order to chime in. At this point its looking like around the end of April is the soonest time available though this may change. Location will depend on the averaged areas of those whom want to attend. Some of the topics mentioned so far include:

* PPVT communication basics
* PPVT structure
* PPVT registration with the state of Vermont
* Growing the Pirate Party in Vermont

The goal isn't necessarily to fully cover these topics but to have initial discussion and then plan further meetings which will allow us to go in depth in an organized and structured fashion. Join us!
